# TRACMIP on Google Cloud

This repository will serve as a collection of resources for accessing TRACMIP (tropical rain belts with an annual cycle and a continent model intercomparison project) data stored on Google Cloud.
The data can be viewed directly at:

This repo also doubles as a [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a reproducible Python environment which allows users to play around with TRACMIP data using the examples provided here. This Binder can be accessed with the button below:
